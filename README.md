# GIS, Drone and Machine Learning for Resource Mapping 
# QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project
This project demonstrates the use of QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) software to visualize and analyze geospatial data. We have worked with a dataset that provides details about the districts of India, helping us understand the spatial relationship between districts and states.

# Overview
**On the very first day of this project**, we familiarized ourselves with the QGIS software. We explored its tools and features to better understand how it works for spatial data analysis. After this, we imported a geospatial dataset that represents India’s map, which includes key administrative divisions like districts and states.

# Key Features:
- District: Represents individual districts within India.
- District Code: A unique identifier for each district.
- State: The state to which each district belongs.

# Objective:
Using this geospatial dataset, the main objective was to:
- Identify which district belongs to which state in India.
- Understand the boundaries of each district and analyze how they share borders with neighboring districts or states.

# Project Steps
1. Learning & Familiarization with QGIS
   The project started with an introduction to QGIS. We learned how to:
     - Navigate the interface.
     - Use the various tools available for working with spatial data.
     - Import and visualize geographic datasets.
     - Perform basic geospatial analysis.

2. Adding the Geospatial Data
After getting acquainted with QGIS, we imported a dataset containing India’s administrative map, focusing on:
     - District Boundaries: Geographic features that represent each district’s boundaries.
     - District Codes: Unique identifiers for every district.
     - States: The states within which the districts are located.

3. Analyzing Spatial Relationships
The geospatial data allows us to:
     - Identify the District in Each State: By visualizing the districts, we can easily see which district belongs to which state.
     - Boundary Analysis: We used QGIS tools to analyze how much boundary each district shares with others. This helps in understanding the spatial relationships between different administrative units in India

# 📝Requirements
- ⬇️ Install QGIS: [official website](https://qgis.org/download/) (latest version).
- 🟢Getting Started:
   1.	Clone this repository to your local machine: https://github.com/RBhuiya/GIS-Drone-and-Machine-Learning-for-Resource-Mapping-QGIS.git 
   2.	Open QGIS, and load the states.shp and districts.shp file located in the Main (Source Data File) folder.
   3.	Explore the data:
        - View district boundaries on the map.
        - Use QGIS query tools to view district codes and states.
        - Utilize QGIS analysis tools to study district borders and how they share boundaries with neighboring districts or states.

# ✅️Benefits of This Analysis
By working with this dataset, users can:
   - Quickly identify which district is located in which state.
   - Analyse how much boundary each district shares with others.
   - Gain insights into administrative divisions and border-sharing relationships, which could be useful for policymaking, resource distribution, and regional planning.
