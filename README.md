# GIS, Drone and Machine Learning for Resource Mapping 
# QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project
This project demonstrates the use of QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) software to visualize and analyze geospatial data. We have worked with a dataset that provides details about the districts of India, helping us understand the spatial relationship between districts and states.

# Overview
On the very first day of this project, we familiarized ourselves with the QGIS software. We explored its tools and features to better understand how it works for spatial data analysis. After this, we imported a geospatial dataset that represents Indiaâ€™s map, which includes key administrative divisions like districts and states.

# Key Features:
â€¢	District: Represents individual districts within India.
â€¢	District Code: A unique identifier for each district.
â€¢	State: The state to which each district belongs.

# Objective:
Using this geospatial dataset, the main objective was to:
â€¢	Identify which district belongs to which state in India.
â€¢	Understand the boundaries of each district and analyze how they share borders with neighboring districts or states.

# Project Steps
1. Learning & Familiarization with QGIS
The project started with an introduction to QGIS. We learned how to:

â€¢	Navigate the interface.
â€¢	Use the various tools available for working with spatial data.
â€¢	Import and visualize geographic datasets.
â€¢	Perform basic geospatial analysis.
2. Adding the Geospatial Data
After getting acquainted with QGIS, we imported a dataset containing Indiaâ€™s administrative map, focusing on:
â€¢	District Boundaries: Geographic features that represent each districtâ€™s boundaries.
â€¢	District Codes: Unique identifiers for every district.
â€¢	States: The states within which the districts are located.
3. Analyzing Spatial Relationships
The geospatial data allows us to:
â€¢	Identify the District in Each State: By visualizing the districts, we can easily see which district belongs to which state.
â€¢	Boundary Analysis: We used QGIS tools to analyze how much boundary each district shares with others. This helps in understanding the spatial relationships between different administrative units in India

Requirements:
â€¢	QGIS: Install the latest version of QGIS from the official website.
Getting Started:
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine:

2.	Open QGIS, and load the states.shp and districts.shp file located in the Main (Source Data File) folder.
3.	Explore the data:
â€¢	View district boundaries on the map.
â€¢	Use QGIS query tools to view district codes and states.
â€¢	Utilize QGIS analysis tools to study district borders and how they share boundaries with neighboring districts or states.

# Benefits of This Analysis
By working with this dataset, users can:
â€¢	Quickly identify which district is located in which state.
â€¢	Analyse how much boundary each district shares with others.
â€¢	Gain insights into administrative divisions and border-sharing relationships, which could be useful for policymaking, resource distribution, and regional planning.
